# ElectionCliGem

This Ruby Gem accesses FiveThirtyEight.com's Presidential Election Forecast and provides a CLI to view the projected winner on the national level, as well as for each individual state.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'election_cli_gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install election_cli_gem

## Usage

Run: election-cli-gem after installing the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
