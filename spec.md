# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application (CLI works on startup)
- [x] Pull data from an external source (http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/)
- [x] Implement both list and detail views (The gem starts by presenting the national forecast of the election. The detail view is provided when the user types in any of the 50 states, plus D.C.  I made a choice not to present a list of all 50 states to the user, seeing it as a bit unwieldy and somewhat redundant as it applies to the target audience for this gem, i.e. election watchers who most likely already know the names of the United States.)
